Device for measuring temperature
I've created this project as a task from college.
We had to implement a device for measuring temperature using orCAD.
The circuit is provided with 4 light indicators(LEDs) which signals the exceeding of a set interval.
We had to search for design data in order to implement our circuit in a specified field.
We had to connect several circuits (temperature sensor, amplifier, comparator + signals) in order to get our final circuit.
It was a complex project because we had to learn to combine different information and to create a bigger project starting from smaller projects.
